Analyzing biases in genealogies using demographic microsimulation.


We conduct a series of experiments on synthetic populations aimed at understanding how some sources of bias in ascendant genealogies can affect the accuracy of demographic estimates. We use the SOCSIM demographic microsimulation program (through the 'rsocsim' package) and data for Sweden from the Human Fertility Collection (1751-1890), the Human Fertility Database (1891-2022), and the Human Mortality Database (1751-2022) to analyze three sources of bias: selection in direct lineages, incomplete reconstruction of family trees, and missing information on some subpopulations.

To reproduce the analysis, please run the scripts numbered 0 to 6. 


To write the input rate files from HFD and HMD and to compare the simulation results with the original input data, 
we use the HMDHFDplus package. Please type your username and password for HMD and HFD in the corresponding space in scripts 0 and 1.

Analyzing biases in genealogies using demographic microsimulation.
We conduct some experiments on synthetic populations, simulated using the 'rsocsim' package and data for Sweden retrieved from the Human Fertility Collection (1751-1890), the Human Fertility Database (1891-2021) and the Human Mortality Database (1751-2021), to assess the effect on demographic estimates of three sources of biases in ascendant genealogies.

NB:
To reproduce the analysis, please run the scripts numbered 0 to 6. 
To write the input rate files from HFD and HMD and to compare the simulation results with the original input data, 
we use the HMDHFDplus package. 
Please type your username and password for both sites in the corresponding space in scripts 0 and 1

Analysing biases in genealogies using SOCSIM demographic microsimulation.
We conduct some 'experiments' on synthetic populations, simulated using the 'rsocsim' package and data for Sweden retrieved from the Human Fertility Database (1891-2021) and the Human Mortality Database (1751-2021), to assess the effect of the main biases in genealogies on demographic estimates.

# Introduction

Genealogies are promising sources for addressing many questions in historical and kinship demography. So far, an incomplete understanding of the biases that affect their representativeness has hindered their full exploitation. Here, we conduct a series of experiments on synthetic populations aimed at understanding how different sources of bias in ascendant genealogies can affect the accuracy of demographic estimates. We use the SOCSIM demographic microsimulation program and data for Sweden from the [Human Fertility Collection (HFC)](https://www.fertilitydata.org/) (1751-1890), the [Human Fertility Database (HFD)](https://www.humanfertility.org/) (1891-2022), and the [Human Mortality Database (HMD)](https://www.mortality.org/) (1751-2022). We analyze three sources of bias: selection in direct lineages, incomplete reconstruction of family trees, and missing information on some subpopulations. We evaluate their effect by comparing common demographic measures estimated from ‘perfectly-recorded’ and ‘bias-infused’ synthetic populations.

# Scripts for reproducible results

Code for reproducible results for the paper "Analyzing biases in genealogies using demographic microsimulation". 

**NB**: If you want to re-run the analysis from scratch (i.e., retrieve the data from [HFC](https://www.fertilitydata.org/), [HFD](https://www.humanfertility.org/), and [HMD](https://www.mortality.org/)), run the microsimulations and reproduce the results), you need R, some standard packages, `HMDHFDplus` and `rsocsim`. 
Please, follow these steps:

1. Download this repository to your computer.  
2. Register at [HFD](https://www.humanfertility.org/) and [HMD](https://www.mortality.org/) and install `HMDHFDplus`.  
To write the input rate files and to compare the simulation results with the original input data, we use data from [HFC](https://www.fertilitydata.org/), [HFD](https://www.humanfertility.org/), and [HMD](https://www.mortality.org/). The last two are retrieved through the `HMDHFDplus` package. To gain full access to the databases, you need to become a registered user at both databases, after accepting the user agreement on their websites: <https://www.humanfertility.org/Account/Auth> and <https://mortality.org/Account/Auth>. 
3. Install `rsocsim`.  
Please go to <https://github.com/MPIDR/rsocsim> to find the instructions on how to install `rsocsim`.  
4. Open the provided RStudio project. 
5. Run the scripts sequentially in the order suggested by the numbers of the files (0-6). 
6. In scripts 0 and 2, please type your username and password for [HFD](https://www.humanfertility.org/) and [HMD](https://www.mortality.org/) in the corresponding space before running the code.  
7. To get exactly the same simulation results, you should use the same randomly generated seeds mentioned in script 1.
